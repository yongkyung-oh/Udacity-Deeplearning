## Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App 

---

In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'(IMPLEMENTATION)'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully! 

> **Note**: Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the Jupyter Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You can then export the notebook by using the menu above and navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. Include the finished document along with this notebook as your submission.

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut.  Markdown cells can be edited by double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

The rubric contains _optional_ "Stand Out Suggestions" for enhancing the project beyond the minimum requirements. If you decide to pursue the "Stand Out Suggestions", you should include the code in this Jupyter notebook.

### Why We're Here 

In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!). 

![Sample Dog Output](images/sample_dog_output.png)

In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.  There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

## Step 0: Import Datasets

Make sure that you've downloaded the required human and dog datasets:
* Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in this project's home directory, at the location `/dog_images`. 

* Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location `/lfw`.  

*Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder.*

In the code cell below, we save the file paths for both the human (LFW) dataset and dog dataset in the numpy arrays `human_files` and `dog_files`.

## Step 1: Detect Humans

In this section, we use OpenCV's implementation of [Haar feature-based cascade classifiers](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html) to detect human faces in images.  

OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on [github](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).  We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the `haarcascades` directory.  In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image.


```python
import cv2                
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                        
%matplotlib inline                               

# extract pre-trained face detector
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml')

# load color (BGR) image
img = cv2.imread(human_files[0])

# convert BGR image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# find faces in image
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)

# print number of faces detected in the image
print('Number of faces detected:', len(faces))

# get bounding box for each detected face
for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
    # add bounding box to color image
    cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2)
    
# convert BGR image to RGB for plotting
cv_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# display the image, along with bounding box
plt.imshow(cv_rgb)
plt.show()
```

    Number of faces detected: 1



![png](output_4_1.png)



```python
img = cv2.imread(human_files[1])

# convert BGR image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# find faces in image
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)

# print number of faces detected in the image
print('Number of faces detected:', len(faces))

# get bounding box for each detected face
for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
    # add bounding box to color image
    cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2)
    
# convert BGR image to RGB for plotting
cv_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# display the image, along with bounding box
plt.imshow(cv_rgb)
plt.show()
```

    Number of faces detected: 1



![png](output_5_1.png)


Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale.  The `detectMultiScale` function executes the classifier stored in `face_cascade` and takes the grayscale image as a parameter.  

In the above code, `faces` is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face.  Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face.  The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as `x` and `y`) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box.  The last two entries in the array (extracted here as `w` and `h`) specify the width and height of the box.

### Write a Human Face Detector

We can use this procedure to write a function that returns `True` if a human face is detected in an image and `False` otherwise.  This function, aptly named `face_detector`, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below.


```python
# returns "True" if face is detected in image stored at img_path
def face_detector(img_path):
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)
    return len(faces) > 0
```

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Human Face Detector

__Question 1:__ Use the code cell below to test the performance of the `face_detector` function.  
- What percentage of the first 100 images in `human_files` have a detected human face?  
- What percentage of the first 100 images in `dog_files` have a detected human face? 

Ideally, we would like 100% of human images with a detected face and 0% of dog images with a detected face.  You will see that our algorithm falls short of this goal, but still gives acceptable performance.  We extract the file paths for the first 100 images from each of the datasets and store them in the numpy arrays `human_files_short` and `dog_files_short`.

__Answer:__ See the output below.


```python
from tqdm import tqdm

human_files_short = human_files[:100]
dog_files_short = dog_files[:100]
#-#-# Do NOT modify the code above this line. #-#-#

## TODO: Test the performance of the face_detector algorithm 
## on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short.
human_count = 0
for i in range(0, 100):
    if face_detector(human_files_short[i]):
        human_count += 1
dog_count = 0
for i in range(0, 100):
    if face_detector(dog_files_short[i]):
        dog_count += 1

print("{} of human face detected out of 100 samples.".format(human_count))
print("{} of dog face detected out of 100 samples.".format(dog_count))
```

    98 of human face detected out of 100 samples.
    17 of dog face detected out of 100 samples.


I wrote my own code and implemented some parts from following reference: https://necromuralist.github.io/In-Too-Deep/posts/nano/dog-breed-classifier/dog-app/


```python
def species_scorer(predictor, true_species, false_species, labels):
    misses = [predictor(str(image)) for image in false_species]
    false_positives = sum(misses)
    true_positives = sum([predictor(str(image)) for image in true_species])
    false_negatives = len(true_species) - true_positives
    others = len(false_species)
    expected = len(true_species)
    values = ("{:.2f}%".format(100 * true_positives/expected),
            "{:.2f}%".format(100 * false_positives/others),
              "{:.2f}".format((2 * true_positives)/(2 * true_positives
                                                    + false_positives
                                                    + false_negatives)))
    table = zip(labels, values)
    print(tabulate(table, tablefmt="github", headers=["Metric", "Value"]))
    return misses
```


```python
face_scorer = partial(species_scorer,
                      true_species=human_files_short,
                      false_species=dog_files_short,
                      labels=("First 100 images in `human_files` detected with a face",
                              "First 100 images in `dog_files` detected with a face",
                              "F1"))
```


```python
open_cv_false_positives = face_scorer(face_detector)
```

    | Metric                                                 | Value   |
    |--------------------------------------------------------|---------|
    | First 100 images in `human_files` detected with a face | 98.00%  |
    | First 100 images in `dog_files` detected with a face   | 17.00%  |
    | F1                                                     | 0.91    |

## Step 2: Detect Dogs

In this section, we use a [pre-trained model](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html) to detect dogs in images.  

### Obtain Pre-trained VGG-16 Model

The code cell below downloads the VGG-16 model, along with weights that have been trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks.  ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of [1000 categories](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a).  

Due to the memory issue, I cleared memory and setup again.


```python
import numpy as np
from functools import partial
from tabulate import tabulate
from glob import glob

# load filenames for human and dog images
human_files = np.array(glob("/data/lfw/*/*"))
dog_files = np.array(glob("/data/dog_images/*/*/*"))

# print number of images in each dataset
print('There are %d total human images.' % len(human_files))
print('There are %d total dog images.' % len(dog_files))
```

    There are 13233 total human images.
    There are 8351 total dog images.



```python
from tqdm import tqdm

human_files_short = human_files[:100]
dog_files_short = dog_files[:100]
```


```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

# define VGG16 model
VGG16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

# check if CUDA is available
use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()

# move model to GPU if CUDA is available
if use_cuda:
    VGG16 = VGG16.cuda()
```


```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if use_cuda else "cpu")
print("Using {}".format(device))
```

    Using cuda


Given an image, this pre-trained VGG-16 model returns a prediction (derived from the 1000 possible categories in ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image.

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Making Predictions with a Pre-trained Model

In the next code cell, you will write a function that accepts a path to an image (such as `'dogImages/train/001.Affenpinscher/Affenpinscher_00001.jpg'`) as input and returns the index corresponding to the ImageNet class that is predicted by the pre-trained VGG-16 model.  The output should always be an integer between 0 and 999, inclusive.

Before writing the function, make sure that you take the time to learn  how to appropriately pre-process tensors for pre-trained models in the [PyTorch documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html).


```python
from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torch.nn as nn

IMAGE_SIZE = 224
IMAGE_HALF_SIZE = IMAGE_SIZE//2

vgg_transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(255),
                                    transforms.CenterCrop(IMAGE_SIZE),
                                    transforms.ToTensor(),
                                    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])])
```


```python
def model_predict(image_path: str, model: nn.Module, transform: transforms.Compose):
    '''
    Use pre-trained VGG-16 model to obtain index corresponding to 
    predicted ImageNet class for image at specified path
    
    Args:
        img_path: path to an image
        
    Returns:
        Index corresponding to VGG-16 model's prediction
    '''
    
    ## TODO: Complete the function.
    ## Load and pre-process an image from the given img_path
    ## Return the *index* of the predicted class for that image
    
    image = Image.open(str(image_path))
    image = transform(image).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
    output = model(image)
    probabilities = torch.exp(output)
    _, top_class = probabilities.topk(1, dim=1)
    return top_class.item()   

VGG16_predict = partial(model_predict, model=VGG16, transform=vgg_transform)
```

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Write a Dog Detector

While looking at the [dictionary](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a), you will notice that the categories corresponding to dogs appear in an uninterrupted sequence and correspond to dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive, to include all categories from `'Chihuahua'` to `'Mexican hairless'`.  Thus, in order to check to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained VGG-16 model, we need only check if the pre-trained model predicts an index between 151 and 268 (inclusive).

Use these ideas to complete the `dog_detector` function below, which returns `True` if a dog is detected in an image (and `False` if not).

According to the image net dictionay, `'Chihuahua'=151` and `'Mexican hairless'=268` are specified. 


```python
DOG_LOWER, DOG_UPPER = 150, 268
```


```python
### returns "True" if a dog is detected in the image stored at img_path
def dog_detector(img_path, predictor: callable=VGG16_predict):
    ## TODO: Complete the function.
    
    return DOG_LOWER < VGG16_predict(img_path) < DOG_UPPER
```

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Dog Detector

__Question 2:__ Use the code cell below to test the performance of your `dog_detector` function.  
- What percentage of the images in `human_files_short` have a detected dog?  
- What percentage of the images in `dog_files_short` have a detected dog?

__Answer:__ See the output below.



```python
def species_scorer(predictor, true_species, false_species, labels):
    misses = [predictor(str(image)) for image in false_species]
    false_positives = sum(misses)
    true_positives = sum([predictor(str(image)) for image in true_species])
    false_negatives = len(true_species) - true_positives
    others = len(false_species)
    expected = len(true_species)
    values = ("{:.2f}%".format(100 * true_positives/expected),
            "{:.2f}%".format(100 * false_positives/others),
              "{:.2f}".format((2 * true_positives)/(2 * true_positives
                                                    + false_positives
                                                    + false_negatives)))
    table = zip(labels, values)
    print(tabulate(table, tablefmt="github", headers=["Metric", "Value"]))
    return misses
```


```python
### TODO: Test the performance of the dog_detector function

                     labels=("Images in `dog_files_short` with a detected dog",
                             "Images in `human_files_short with a detected dog", "F1"))
```


```python
VGG_false_dogs = dog_scorer(dog_detector)
```

    | Metric                                           | Value   |
    |--------------------------------------------------|---------|
    | Images in `dog_files_short` with a detected dog  | 100.00% |
    | Images in `human_files_short with a detected dog | 2.00%   |
    | F1                                               | 0.99    |


We suggest VGG-16 as a potential network to detect dog images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other pre-trained networks (such as [Inception-v3](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html#inception-v3), [ResNet-50](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html#id3), etc).  Please use the code cell below to test other pre-trained PyTorch models.  If you decide to pursue this _optional_ task, report performance on `human_files_short` and `dog_files_short`.

## Implementation using Inception


```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

inception = models.inception_v3(pretrained=True)
inception.eval()

# check if CUDA is available
use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()

# move model to GPU if CUDA is available
if use_cuda:
    inception = inception.cuda()
```


```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if use_cuda else "cpu")
print("Using {}".format(device))
```

    Using cuda



```python
from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torch.nn as nn

INCEPTION_IMAGE_SIZE = 299

inception_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(INCEPTION_IMAGE_SIZE),
                                           transforms.CenterCrop(INCEPTION_IMAGE_SIZE),
                                           transforms.ToTensor(),

inception_predict = partial(model_predict, model=inception, transform=inception_transforms)
```


```python
inception_dog_detector = partial(dog_detector, predictor=inception_predict)
```


```python
inception_false_dogs = dog_scorer(inception_dog_detector)
```

    | Metric                                           | Value   |
    |--------------------------------------------------|---------|
    | Images in `dog_files_short` with a detected dog  | 99.00%  |
    | Images in `human_files_short with a detected dog | 1.00%   |
    | F1                                               | 0.99    |


## Implementation using ResNet50

Due to the memory issue, I cleared memory and setup again.


```python
import numpy as np
from functools import partial
from tabulate import tabulate
from glob import glob

# load filenames for human and dog images
human_files = np.array(glob("/data/lfw/*/*"))
dog_files = np.array(glob("/data/dog_images/*/*/*"))

# print number of images in each dataset
print('There are %d total human images.' % len(human_files))
print('There are %d total dog images.' % len(dog_files))
```

    There are 13233 total human images.
    There are 8351 total dog images.



```python
from tqdm import tqdm

human_files_short = human_files[:100]
dog_files_short = dog_files[:100]
```

I wrote my own code and implemented some parts from following reference: http://kitmarks.com/dog_app.html


```python
from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50

# define ResNet50 model
ResNet50_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')
```

    Using TensorFlow backend.

## Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

Now that we have functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, we need a way to predict breed from images.  In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%.  In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.

We mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.  

Brittany | Welsh Springer Spaniel
- | - 
<img src="images/Brittany_02625.jpg" width="100"> | <img src="images/Welsh_springer_spaniel_08203.jpg" width="200">

It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).  

Curly-Coated Retriever | American Water Spaniel
- | -
<img src="images/Curly-coated_retriever_03896.jpg" width="200"> | <img src="images/American_water_spaniel_00648.jpg" width="200">


Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.  

Yellow Labrador | Chocolate Labrador | Black Labrador
- | -
<img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06457.jpg" width="150"> | <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06455.jpg" width="240"> | <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06449.jpg" width="220">

We also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.  

Remember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning.  Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition.  And, of course, have fun!

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset

Use the code cell below to write three separate [data loaders](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at `dog_images/train`, `dog_images/valid`, and `dog_images/test`, respectively).  You may find [this documentation on custom datasets](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html) to be a useful resource.  If you are interested in augmenting your training and/or validation data, check out the wide variety of [transforms](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html?highlight=transform)!

Due to the memory issue, I cleared memory and setup again.


```python
# Install somd additional packages to use
# Install a pip package in the current Jupyter kernel
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install tabulate
```

    Requirement already satisfied: tabulate in /opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages
    [33mYou are using pip version 9.0.1, however version 19.0.3 is available.
    You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.[0m



```python
import numpy as np
from functools import partial
from tabulate import tabulate
from glob import glob

# load filenames for human and dog images
human_files = np.array(glob("/data/lfw/*/*"))
dog_files = np.array(glob("/data/dog_images/*/*/*"))

# print number of images in each dataset
print('There are %d total human images.' % len(human_files))
print('There are %d total dog images.' % len(dog_files))
```

    There are 13233 total human images.
    There are 8351 total dog images.



```python
from tqdm import tqdm

human_files_short = human_files[:100]
dog_files_short = dog_files[:100]
```


```python
import os

from torchvision import datasets

from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torch.nn as nn

### TODO: Write data loaders for training, validation, and test sets
## Specify appropriate transforms, and batch_sizes

SCRATCH_IMAGE_SIZE = 224

train_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomRotation(30),
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(SCRATCH_IMAGE_SIZE),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])])

test_transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(350),
                                     transforms.CenterCrop(SCRATCH_IMAGE_SIZE),
                                     transforms.ToTensor(),
                                     transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])])
```


```python
from datetime import datetime
from PIL import ImageFile
ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True
```

I wrote my own code and implemented some parts from following reference: https://necromuralist.github.io/In-Too-Deep/posts/nano/dog-breed-classifier/dog-app/

Specify the path of dataset and data loaders for the dog dataset


```python
path = os.getcwd()  
print ("The current working directory is %s" % path)  
```

    The current working directory is /home/workspace/dog_project



```python
from pathlib import Path

DOG_PATH = Path("/data/dog_images")
dog_training_path = DOG_PATH.joinpath("train")
dog_validation_path = DOG_PATH.joinpath("valid")
dog_testing_path = DOG_PATH.joinpath("test")
```


```python
training = datasets.ImageFolder(root=str(dog_training_path),
                                transform=train_transform)
validation = datasets.ImageFolder(root=str(dog_validation_path),
                                  transform=test_transform)
testing = datasets.ImageFolder(root=str(dog_testing_path),
                               transform=test_transform)
```


```python
BATCH_SIZE = 32
WORKERS = 0

train_batches = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(training, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
                                            shuffle=True, num_workers=WORKERS)
validation_batches = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    validation, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=True, num_workers=WORKERS)
test_batches = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    testing, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=True, num_workers=WORKERS)

loaders_scratch = dict(train=train_batches,
                       validation=validation_batches,
                       test=test_batches)
```

**Question 3:** Describe your chosen procedure for preprocessing the data. 
- How does your code resize the images (by cropping, stretching, etc)?  What size did you pick for the input tensor, and why?
- Did you decide to augment the dataset?  If so, how (through translations, flips, rotations, etc)?  If not, why not?


**Answer**: 
* I selected the same size as inception_v3 (299 px)
* The training images are resized by cropping and testing images are resized by scaling then cropping.
* The transformation includes rotation, cropping and horizontal flipping.

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Model Architecture

Create a CNN to classify dog breed.  Use the template in the code cell below.


```python
BREEDS = len(training.classes)
print("There are {} breeds.".format(BREEDS))
```

    There are 133 breeds.



```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

LAYER_ONE_IN = 3
LAYER_ONE_OUT = 16
LAYER_TWO_OUT = LAYER_ONE_OUT * 2 # 32
LAYER_THREE_OUT = LAYER_TWO_OUT * 2 # 64
LAYER_FOUR_OUT = LAYER_THREE_OUT * 2 # 128
FLATTEN_TO = (SCRATCH_IMAGE_SIZE//16)**2 * LAYER_FOUR_OUT 
FULLY_CONNECTED_OUT = int(str(FLATTEN_TO)[:3])//100 * 100
KERNEL = 3
PADDING = 1
```


```python
# define the CNN architecture
class Net(nn.Module):
    ### TODO: choose an architecture, and complete the class
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(LAYER_ONE_IN, LAYER_ONE_OUT,
                               KERNEL, padding=PADDING)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(LAYER_ONE_OUT, LAYER_TWO_OUT,
                               KERNEL, padding=PADDING)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(LAYER_TWO_OUT, LAYER_THREE_OUT,
                               KERNEL, padding=PADDING)
        self.conv4 = nn.Conv2d(LAYER_THREE_OUT, LAYER_FOUR_OUT,
                               KERNEL, padding=PADDING)
        # max pooling layer
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        # linear layer
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(FLATTEN_TO, FULLY_CONNECTED_OUT)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(FULLY_CONNECTED_OUT, BREEDS)
        # dropout layer
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.25)
        return
    
    ## Define layers of a CNN
    def forward(self, x):
        ## Define forward behavior
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv3(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv4(x)))
        
        x = x.view(-1, FLATTEN_TO)
        x = self.dropout(x)

        x = self.dropout(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))
        return self.fc2(x)

#-#-# You so NOT have to modify the code below this line. #-#-#

# instantiate the CNN
model_scratch = Net()

# check if CUDA is available
use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()

# move tensors to GPU if CUDA is available
if use_cuda:
    model_scratch.cuda()
```

__Question 4:__ Outline the steps you took to get to your final CNN architecture and your reasoning at each step.  

__Answer:__ 

I tried several CNN strucure, but most of them showed poor result or unexpected error. 
* 4 convolution layers, which doule the depth while halving the height and width (using MaxPool)
* Flatten the layer with 300 output
* To reduce the likelihood of overfitting, model is applied to dropout the activation layers
* Applied ReLU activation to make the model nonlinear

* Key idea from following reference: https://necromuralist.github.io/In-Too-Deep/posts/nano/dog-breed-classifier/dog-app/

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Loss Function and Optimizer

Use the next code cell to specify a [loss function](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions) and [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html).  Save the chosen loss function as `criterion_scratch`, and the optimizer as `optimizer_scratch` below.


```python
import torch.optim as optimizer

### TODO: select loss function
criterion_scratch = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

### TODO: select optimizer
optimizer_scratch = optimizer.SGD(model_scratch.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
```

## Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

You will now use transfer learning to create a CNN that can identify dog breed from images.  Your CNN must attain at least 60% accuracy on the test set.

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset

Use the code cell below to write three separate [data loaders](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at `dogImages/train`, `dogImages/valid`, and `dogImages/test`, respectively). 

If you like, **you are welcome to use the same data loaders from the previous step**, when you created a CNN from scratch.


```python
## TODO: Specify data loaders
loaders_transfer = loaders_scratch
```

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Model Architecture

Use transfer learning to create a CNN to classify dog breed.  Use the code cell below, and save your initialized model as the variable `model_transfer`.


```python
import torchvision.models as models
import torch.nn as nn

## TODO: Specify model architecture 

model_transfer = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

for param in model_transfer.features.parameters():
    param.require_grad = False

num_features = model_transfer.classifier[6].in_features
features = list(model_transfer.classifier.children())[:-1] 
features.extend([nn.Linear(num_features, BREEDS)]) 
model_transfer.classifier = nn.Sequential(*features)

# check if CUDA is available
use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()

if use_cuda:
    model_transfer = model_transfer.cuda()
```

## Step 5: Write your Algorithm

Write an algorithm that accepts a file path to an image and first determines whether the image contains a human, dog, or neither.  Then,
- if a __dog__ is detected in the image, return the predicted breed.
- if a __human__ is detected in the image, return the resembling dog breed.
- if __neither__ is detected in the image, provide output that indicates an error.

You are welcome to write your own functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, but feel free to use the `face_detector` and `human_detector` functions developed above.  You are __required__ to use your CNN from Step 4 to predict dog breed.  

Some sample output for our algorithm is provided below, but feel free to design your own user experience!

## Step 6: Test Your Algorithm

In this section, you will take your new algorithm for a spin!  What kind of dog does the algorithm think that _you_ look like?  If you have a dog, does it predict your dog's breed accurately?  If you have a cat, does it mistakenly think that your cat is a dog?

### (IMPLEMENTATION) Test Your Algorithm on Sample Images!

Test your algorithm at least six images on your computer.  Feel free to use any images you like.  Use at least two human and two dog images.  

__Question 6:__ Is the output better than you expected :) ?  Or worse :( ?  Provide at least three possible points of improvement for your algorithm.

__Answer:__ (Three possible points for improvement)
* More dataset
* Hyper-parameter tuning process
* Model ensemble
* Additional techniques (ex. Meta-learning)


```python
## TODO: Execute your algorithm from Step 6 on
## at least 6 images on your computer.
## Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.

## suggested code, below
for file in np.hstack((human_files[:5], dog_files[:5])):
    run_app(file)
```
