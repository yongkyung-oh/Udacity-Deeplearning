## Project 1. Neural network for predicting bikesharing: 
In this project, you'll build your first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. We've provided some of the code, but left the implementation of the neural network up to you (for the most part). After you've submitted this project, feel free to explore the data and the model more.

## Project 2. Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App
In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

## Project 3. TV Script Generation
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Project 4. Face Generation

In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Your goal is to get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from **loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks**. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
